# mycv
My CV.  Both content, but also holds a number of nice LaTeX templates (mostly from others - thanks).

I found the original CV template (which I've used but not changed) on https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d6934d06493ab79b531f40f hosted by the Overleaf project which itself looks very interesting.
